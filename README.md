## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn seaborn plotly
```

## Data Overview

The dataset used in this analysis is the `hotel_bookings.csv` file. It contains information on hotel bookings, including booking dates, number of adults, children, type of room, and more.

```python
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_hotel_bookings.csv')
```

## Data Preprocessing

Initial inspection of the dataset is performed using commands like `df.head()` and `df.tail()` to understand the structure and content. Data cleaning steps include handling missing values and converting data types where necessary.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is carried out to gain insights into the distribution of various features and their relationships. This involves:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating measures such as mean, median, and mode.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying correlations between different features.
- **Group Analysis**: Analyzing data based on specific groups (e.g., type of hotel, customer segment).

## Visualization and Insights

Visualizations are created using libraries like `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly`. Some of the key visualizations include:

- **Booking Trends Over Time**: A line graph showing how bookings vary over time.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Pie charts and bar plots showing the distribution of different customer segments.
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: To visualize the strength of relationships between features.

These visualizations help in identifying patterns such as peak booking periods, the most popular room types, and the demographic breakdown of customers.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides actionable insights into the booking patterns of hotels, helping management to optimize pricing strategies, marketing efforts, and resource allocation.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies and tools:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for analysis and data manipulation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for writing and running code, visualizing results, and documenting the analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling data frames.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for arrays.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Plotly**: A graphing library that makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python, used here for potential modeling or analysis tasks.
- **Google Colab** (Optional): If running the notebook in the cloud, Google Colab provides a free environment with GPU support.
